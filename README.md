# Julia 1.0 Programming Complete Reference Guide
Julia offers the high productivity and ease of use of Python and R with the lightning-fast speed of C++. There’s never been a better time to learn this language, thanks to its large-scale adoption across a wide range of domains, right from fintech, to biotech, and artificial intelligence (AI).

Beginning with an introduction to the language, this Learning Path illustrates how you can analyze the Iris dataset using DataFrames. With the help of practical examples, you’ll also get to grips with arrays and matrices, in addition to understanding how type conversions and promotions work. As you cover more chapters, you’ll explore functions, methods, and multiple dispatches while building a web scraper and a web app. Further on, you’ll delve into machine learning, where you'll discover how to build a book recommendation system. After metaprogramming, the concluding topics will help you gain insights into dates and time, time series analysis, visualization, and forecasting.

By the end of this Learning Path, you’ll be well versed with Julia and have the skills you need to leverage its high speed and efficiency for your applications.

This Learning Path includes content from the following Packt products:

• Julia 1.0 Programming - Second Edition by Ivo Balbaert
• Julia Programming Projects by Adrian Salceanu
